<h2>Continuous 1-D Inversion</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Continuous, one-dimensional inversions can be computed from <a href="apparent_resistivity.html">apparent resistivity</a> data sets. <br>
The Bostick inverse is the most common. A continuous inverse consists of two data sets. One record must contain a set of values representing depths which are strictly increasing. The units for the depths are meters unless the UNITS option specifies UNITS=FT. The second record contains a set of resistivity values which correspond one-to-one with the depth values. It is always in units of W-meters.<br>
Any continuous inversion data blocks in a data section are assumed to be derived from the preceding <a href="apparent_resistivity.html">apparent resistivity</a> data blocks. If this is not true, it should be clearly indicated in the >INFO section. Unless specified otherwise by the ROT option, the inversions are assumed to be computed for the measurements in the measurement directions as defined in the >DEFINEMEAS section.<br>
For tensor MT data, continuous inversions may be delivered for up to four apparent resistivities, although inversions for only RHOXY and RHOYX are usually included. 
The TYPE option should clearly indicate the technique used for inversion. If additional explanation is indicated, it should be in the >INFO section. For Bostick inversion, the type should indicate whether the apparent resistivity amplitudes (TYPE=BOSTICK-AMP) or Hilbert transform of the phase (TYPE=BOSTICK-PHS) data was used for estimating the slopes used in the inversion.
