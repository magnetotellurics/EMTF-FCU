<h1>Statistical estimates for MT Transfer Functions</h1>
<h2>Inverse signal covariance: INVSIGCOV</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The inverse signal covariance $\mathbf{S}$, as defined in Eisel & Egbert (2001), 
is one of the two building block matrices of the impedance <a href="covariance.html">covariance</a>.
It can be derived from first principles by setting up the estimation of the impedance as a linear regression problem.
Consider the output channels $\mathbf{E}$ as the response variable, $\mathbf{H}$ as the input variable, 
and the impedance $\mathbf{Z}$ as the unknown parameter matrix, resulting in 
</p>
<div lang="latex">
    \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{H} \mathbf{Z}^T + \epsilon,
</div>
<p>
where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ are defined, for simplicity of notation, as <em>horizontal</em>, rather than vertical, vectors. 
If we were to transpose both sides of the equation, we would arrive at the more traditional definition of the impedance. 
To further generalize the analysis, we note that the same expression may be used for a variety of output channels, 
so that the definition of $\mathbf{E}$ may include the vertical magnetic field component, as well as, or instead 
of the electric field output channels, and the same analysis would apply.
</p>
<p>
Then, for the single-station magnetotelluric processing, the inverse signal power matrix may be computed as 
</p>
<div lang="latex">
    \mathbf{S} = (\mathbf{H}^* \mathbf{H})^{-1},
 </div>
<p>
and for the remote-reference magnetotelluric processing, 
</p>
<div lang="latex">
    \mathbf{S} = (\mathbf{R}^* \mathbf{H})^{-1} (\mathbf{R}^* \mathbf{R}) (\mathbf{H}^* \mathbf{R})^{-1},
</div>
<p>
where $\mathbf{R}$ is the horizontal magnetic field at the remote site, and $\mathbf{H}$ is the local horizontal magnetic field.
