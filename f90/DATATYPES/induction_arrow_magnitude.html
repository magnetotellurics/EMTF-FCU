<h2>MT Induction Arrow Magnitude (Parkinson convention): INDMAG</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The Induction Arrow is a graphical representation of <a href="tipper.html">tipper</a> T. The real and imaginary parts of complex tipper components Tx,Ty can be combined to form +/- (Txr,Tyr) and +/- (Txi,Tyi). In Parkinson convention -(Txr,Tyr) is chosen as Induction Arrow, which tends to point toward regions of higher conductivity. Thus Induction Arrow magnitude can be defined as:
