<h1>Statistical estimates for MT Transfer Functions</h1>
<h2>Variance: VAR</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The variance of a random variable X is defined as the average of the squared differences:
<div lang="latex">
        \sigma^2 = \mathbf{Var}(X) = E[(X-E[X])^2}
</div>
<br>
where E[X] is the expected value of X, also known as the mean of X.
</p>
<p>
In the EDI files, the variance of each impedance component is traditionally specified by, e.g., ZXY.VAR. 
This is a real positive quantity. Traditionally, EDI files do not support the full error covariance. 
If only the variance is provided, it gives insufficient information to formally estimate the variance of a rotated impedance.
Thus, no formal rotation of data in traditional EDI files can be performed.
XML files and Z-files can also provide the full error covariance in the form of two matrices: 
the inverse signal power $\mathbf{S}$ and the residual covariance matrix $\mathbf{N}$ (Eisel & Egbert, 2001). 
The full covariance is the Kronecker delta product of the two,
</p>
<div lang="latex">
    \mathbf{Cov}[\mathbf{Z}] = \mathbf{N} \otimes \mathbf{S},
</div>
<p>so that</p>
<div lang="latex">
    \mathbf{Cov}[Z_{ij} Z_{i' j'}] = N_{i i'} S_{j j'}, \;\;\; j,j' = 1,2 \;\;\;\mathtt{ and }\;\;\; i,i' = 1,\ldots,N,
</div>
<p>
where $N$ is the number of output channels. The variance is computed using the diagonal elements of $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf{S}$,
</p>
<div lang="latex">
    \sigma^2_{ij} = \mathbf{Var}[Z_{ij}] = \mathbf{Cov}[Z_{ij} Z_{ij}] = N_{i i} S_{j j}, \;\;\; j = 1,2 \;\;\;\mathtt{ and }\;\;\; i = 1,\ldots,N.
</div>
<p>
<p>
 The variance of the real or imaginary part of an impedance component would be $\sigma^2_{ij}/2$. 
 However, p 52 of the EDI manual explains that e.g. ZXY.VAR refers to the complex variance 
 (while ZXYR.VAR would mean the variance of the real part).
 To be consistent with this definition, we do not divide the variance by two.
</p>
<p>
 Standard error of a real or imaginary part of an impedance component is then obtained as $\sqrt{\sigma^2_{ij}/2}$.
