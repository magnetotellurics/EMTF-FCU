<h2>Covariance: COV</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The covariance between two random variables X and Y is defined as the expected product of their deviations from their individual expected values:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div lang="latex">
cov(X,Y)=E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])}
</div>
<br>
where E[X] is the expected value of X, also known as the mean of X.
