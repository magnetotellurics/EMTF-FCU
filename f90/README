1. Install a g95 or similar Fortran 95 compiler

2. Download the newest version of FoX library,
   http://uszla.me.uk/space/software/FoX/
   and unpack it to a directory $FOX_DIR

3. Compile FoX package

   cd $FOX_DIR
   ./configure
   make

NB: if you move FoX in the file system, reconfigure 

4. Go back to the EMTF FCU directory. Change the
   $FOX_DIR variable in the Makefile to your FoX path.
   Compile EMTF FCU by typing 'make'.
   
5. This comment only applies if you would like to 
   use the software to create XML files for archiving.
   In this case, you need to create an XML configuration
   file which looks like
   
<Configuration>
<Source>OSU</Source>
<Project>USArray</Project>
<Experiment>USArray Cascadia</Experiment>
<YearCollected>2007</YearCollected>
<OrthogonalGeographic>1</OrthogonalGeographic>    
<ProcessedBy>Gary Egbert and Prasanta Patro</ProcessedBy>
<ProcessingSoftware>EMTF</ProcessingSoftware>
<ProcessingTag></ProcessingTag>
<RunList>Runs.xml</RunList>
<SiteList>Sites.xml</SiteList>
</Configuration>
   
   This is where any user-defined information about
   the experiment is stored. The lists, if specified,
   should contain information about runs and the sites
   in the experiment, as described in module read_lists.f90
   
   The program looks for the configuration file in the
   same directory where the input file is located.
   
NB: If you have the lists, use them by first running
    z2xml, then xml2edi. Note that the program z2edi
    does not require FoX library to be installed, and
    it does not use the additional XML information.
   
 Enjoy!

PS FoX example:


doc => parseFile("input.xml")

nlist => getElementsByTagname(doc, "interestingElement")

do i = 0, getLength(nlist)-1
  np => item(nlist, i)

  call extractDataAttribute(np, "att", value)

  if (value==somethingInteresting) then
    call extractDataContent(np, data)
  endif
enddo

call destroy(doc)
