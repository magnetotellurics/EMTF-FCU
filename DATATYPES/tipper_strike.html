<h2>MT Tipper Strike: TSTRIKE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The tipper principal direction or "strike" can be defined as the angle which:
</p>
<div lang="latex">\\
\text{1) Minimizes }|T'_{x}|^2,\\
\text{2) Maximizes }|T'_{y}|^2,\text{ or}\\
\text{3) Maximizes }|T'_{x}|^2+|T'_{y}|^2\\
</div>
<p>
where T 'x and T 'y are the <a href="tipper.html">tipper</a> components rotated to the tipper strike angle. However, this method
has the same 90 degree ambiguity as the <a href="impedance_strike.html">impedance principal direction</a>. An alternative, preferred method for defining the tipper principal direction, B, is given by Jupp and Vozoff, 1976:
</p>
<div lang="latex">
B=\frac{(TxR^2 + TyR^2)*tan^{-1} \bigg( \frac{TyR}{TxR} \bigg) + (TxI^2 + TyI^2)*tan^{-1} \bigg( \frac{TyI}{TxI} \bigg)+90^o}
{|Tx|^2+|Ty|^2}\\
</div>
<p>
where TxR, TxI, TyR, and TyI represent the real and imaginary parts of Tx and Ty respectively, and B is
measured clockwise from true north in the defined azimuthal coordinate system. This is the angle which
maximizes the <a href="coherence.html">coherency</a> between the vertical and horizontal magnetic field. It has an inherent ambiguity
of plus or minus 180 degrees. However, one can choose the principal direction for which the phase of
COH(H'z,H'x) (the coherency between the vertical magnetic field, Hz, and the horizontal field component,
Hx, rotated to the chosen principal direction) falls between +90 degrees and -90 degrees from the real
axis in the complex plane.
